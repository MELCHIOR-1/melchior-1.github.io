One of the rewards of switching my website to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is the
ability to support **MathJax**, which means I can write LaTeX-like equations that get
nicely displayed in a web browser, like this one \\( \sqrt{\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}} \\) or
this one \\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \\).

### What's MathJax?

If you check MathJax website [(www.mathjax.org)](http://www.mathjax.org/) you'll see
that it *is an open source JavaScript display engine for mathematics that works in all
browsers*.
